## Technologies Used

## Architecture and Development

Remindly is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which enhances code organization, testability, and scalability. Provider is used to manage application state efficiently, while Flutter ensures a smooth cross-platform experience on both Android and iOS.

Whether you need to stay on top of personal tasks or delegate responsibilities to friends, family, or colleagues, Remindly is here to keep everyone accountable and organized.
